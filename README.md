# Children-s-Storybook-Illustrator
This project explores how AI can help create fully illustrated childrenâ€™s storybooks with minimal effort. The workflow combines a Large Language Model (LLM) for generating short, simple stories and a text-to-image model for producing corresponding illustrations. The result is a mini-book where each page contains both text and a matching image.
